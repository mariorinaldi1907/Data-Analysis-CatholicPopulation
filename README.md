Catholic Heritage: Exploring the changes to the demographics of the Catholic Church over time due to socio-economic factors 

# Catholic Demographic Analysis (1945â€“2010)

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of demographic trends within the global Roman Catholic population from 1945 to 2010. Motivated by recent ecclesiastical developments and personal observations of Catholic communities abroad, the study investigates how social, political, and cultural factors have shaped the distribution and growth of Catholic populations worldwide.

## Objectives

**Primary Aim:**  
To examine and interpret global shifts in Catholic demographics over a 65-year period, using empirical data and analytical techniques.

**Specific Objectives:**
- Analyze historical data to identify long-term demographic trends.
- Compare regional patterns of Catholic population growth and decline.
- Examine potential correlations between demographic trends and external socio-political variables.
- Explore the implications of contemporary Church developments on population dynamics.
- Employ data science methodologies, including statistical and geospatial analysis, to derive insights.
- Provide informed recommendations for future research, ecclesiastical planning, and policy development.

## Data Sources
Three primary datasets were used in this study:
1. **Global Population Dataset:** Religious population data from 1945 to 2010 at ten-year intervals.
2. **National Dataset:** Catholic demographic data across individual countries within the same time frame.
3. **Continental Dataset:** Aggregated religious data across major continents.

These datasets collectively enable cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses at multiple geographic levels.

## Methodologies
- **Data Preprocessing:** Filtering, reshaping, and merging of datasets using `pandas`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization of demographic patterns over time.
- **Time Series Decomposition:** Analysis of trend, seasonality, and residual components for each continent.
- **Geospatial and Comparative Analysis:** Continental and national population comparisons.
- **Visualization Tools:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels`.

## Key Findings
- The global Catholic population increased steadily, though not at a pace comparable to the exponential rise in world population.
- Significant regional variations were observed:
  - **Africa and Latin America** showed consistent growth.
  - **Europe** exhibited stagnation or decline, often correlated with socio-political shifts.
  - **Asia and the Middle East** experienced modest or minimal growth.
- Findings highlight the growing presence of Catholicism in the Global South and the challenges faced in traditional strongholds.

## Limitations
- Data extends only to 2010, potentially omitting more recent trends.
- Some countries and regions are underrepresented in the source data.
- Lack of contextual metadata limits deeper interpretation of causative factors.
